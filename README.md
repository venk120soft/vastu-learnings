# Vastu-Learnings

Vastu Shastra is an ancient shatra to provide us the better health, wealth by following right directions for each action and things to place

## Choosing the plot
Avoid choosing the plots near Smashanam and temples

Reason for new temples, we should always keep clean near temple and dwaga sthambam needa(shade) Inti pai padaraadhu hence it's okay to have after 3 times 
1. Shape of the Plot
2. Cut or extensions to watch
3. Veedhi Potu or Veedhi Choopu

## 1 Shape of the Plot
Apart from all the shapes Rectangle is an ideal shape for house construction

width:length => 1:2 is good with east or west facing

Second best is Square plot which is 1:1

## 2 Cut or extensions to watch
It is best not to have cut or extensions to the plot. Though below are acceptable

North East Extension is acceptable

## 3 Veedhi Potu or Veedhi Choopu
North East Veedhi potu is good

For any plot, to decide the directions we should find the brhmastan first and We have to measure the directions from the Brhma stan point

In case of any angle change, take necessary precautions or actions then decide the exact directions. Brahmastan is the main place for any home to start building

Before looking down => We have plots in different sizes, dimensions so to identify right dimensions look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMDgK5WPCMU

Once everything looks good get the plan ready 

# Then do Vasthu pooja on the day of muggu based on the plan

Brahmastana is best place for Shiva Panchayathanam Pooja 

- Nairuthi - Vinayaka
- Vayuvyam  - Parvathi devi
- Agneyam - Surya dev

** Plot is divided into 9 parts in each direction**
For Rectanngle types make sure find the 9 parts properly(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMDgK5WPCMU)

4.5 is the middle for any direction

1) North East(Eeshanyam) is best place for Pooja. 1 to 4.5 any place towards East is very good for pooja https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7QESiu0Hg
2) In some videos: North- East is worst place to place Pooja mandir https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-yfwqUG7DA 

Both seems to be reasonable, if we want to place pooja gadhi in NE it is best to keep it in 4 to 5 place. and do not build gadhi instead keep it in wall

becoz we endup closing the doors in NE hence NE should be open every time and NE it feels like we are decreasing NE place hence 

So to avoid this confusions West side towards NW 4th place we can build the pooja gadhi 


**
Vinayaka idol trunk in home should always be left side(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP3FhY-UOcU)**

We should not have 2 or more of same god idols or photos. only 1 of kind is okay. 
Shiv ling is having lot of things to take care hence, don't keep shiva linga inside home
Krishna, Vinayaka idols should always be single not with their wifes and krishna should not be with flute

Stone, copper, silver, gold idols only we should use, In case if we want to take out any idols or photos from pooja room then we should send them in to any tempples

North East(Eeshanyam) is jala sthanam we should put sump/Bavi/Boor
In between 3 to 4.5 place only in either sides(towards north or east). 2 to 1 parts strictly avoided as it is related vastu bhagavan head

Keep Boar in North direction(Is for Money) of North-East at 3 to 4.5 places and Keep sump in East Direction(Is for fame) 3 to 4.5 places for betterment

North (exact 4.5) is the kubera place, it's a better place for keeping the lockers(Money) under the ground

## Where to sleep owner of the house?
South West(Nairuthi) is the best place to sleep. and towards south direction and make sure there is no, water tank or bheam is not on top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO1XfLdlDy8

South-West is also good place to keep the Money locker but no 1 direction for Money storing is north(Uttaram) kubera stana

Head towards South direction is good => Owner should sleep in South West (Nairuthi) direction always, bed should touch to South direction

## Septic tank where to construct
Septic tank or toilets are not good option to keep it inside home. But if at all it is required then North- West(Vayuvyam) towards north(uttaram) 3 to 4 places can be taken 4th place is recommended

South- East(Aagneyam) 3 to 4 towards east(Thurpu) can be taken for septic tank construction. 4th place is recommended

## Compound walls

## Sleeping directions
1) Head towards South direction is good => Owner should sleep in South West (Nairuthi) direction always, bed should touch to South direction
2) Head towards East direction is good => Bed should not touch East direction
## Photos to keep in drections
1) Expired parents(Ancestors) photos should keep in south direction should face to north and be placed above 6 to 7 feet from the floor. And not in main hall
2) Main door entrance Kamadhenu or Guru(Sai baba) photo can be placed towards East direction and faced to west
