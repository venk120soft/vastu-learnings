# Vastu-Learnings

Vastu Shastr is an ancient shatra to provide us the better health, wealth by following right directions for each action and things to place

## Choosing the plot
Avoid choosing the plots near Smashanam and temples

Reason for new temples, we should always keep clean near temple and dwaga sthambam needa(shade) Inti pai padaraadhu hence it's okay to have after 3 times 
1. Shape of the Plot
2. Cut or extensions to watch
3. Veedhi Potu or Veedhi Choopu

## 1 Shape of the Plot
Apart from all the shapes Rectangle is an ideal shape for house construction

width:length => 1:2 is good with east or west facing

Second best is Square plot which is 1:1

## 2 Cut or extensions to watch
It is best not have cut or extensions to the plot have any defects. Though below are acceptable

North East Extension is acceptable

## 3 Veedhi Potu or Veedhi Choopu
North East Veedhi potu is good

For any plot, to decide the directions we should find the brhmastan first and We have to measure the directions from the Brhma stan point

In case of any angle change, take necessary precautions or actions then decide the exact directions. Brahmastan is the main place for any home to start building

Before looking down => We have plots in different sizes, dimensions so to identify right dimensions look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMDgK5WPCMU

Once everything looks
**Plot is divided into 9 parts in each direction**
For Rectanngle types make sure find the 9 parts properly(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMDgK5WPCMU)

4.5 is the middle for any direction

North East(Eeshanyam) is best place for Pooja. 1 to 4.5 any place towards East is very good for pooja https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7QESiu0Hg

North East(Eeshanyam) is jala sthanam we should put sump/Bavi/Boor
In between 3 to 4.5 place only in either sides(towards north or east). 2 to 1 parts stricly avoided as it is related vastu bhagavan head

Keep Boar in North direction(Is for Money) of North-East at 3 to 4.5 places and Keep sump in East Direction(Is for fame) 3 to 4.5 places for betterment

North (exact 4.5) is the kubera place, it's a better place for keeping the lockers(Money) under the ground

## Where to sleep owner of the house?
South West(Nairuthi) is the best place to sleep. and towards south direction and make sure there is no, water tank or bheam is not there

South-West is also good place to keep the Money locker but no 1 direction for Money storing is north(Uttaram) kubera stana

## Septic tank where to construct
Septic tank or toilets are not good option to keep it inside home. But if at all it is required then North- West(Vayuvyam) towards north(uttaram) 2.6 to 4 places can be taken or
South- East(Aagneyam) 2.6 to 4 towards east(Thurpu) can be taken for septic tank construction
## Compound walls
